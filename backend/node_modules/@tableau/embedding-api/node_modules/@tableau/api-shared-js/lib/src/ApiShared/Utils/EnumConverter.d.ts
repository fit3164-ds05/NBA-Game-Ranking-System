/**
 * This class converts from a source enum value to destination enum
 * value given a mapping from source to destination when constructed.
 *
 * Note: This exact same class is defined in api-core.  Given its small
 * nature, it is not worth having in a separate project to share this between
 * api-core and api-shared.  If more utility functionality is added that is used by api-core
 * and api-shared but has no other dependecies, a utiltity project might be merited,
 * and this class could be moved.
